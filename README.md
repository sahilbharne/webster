🧠 AI Features in Depth

When users upload artwork, the backend uses an AI model (e.g., OpenAI Vision or ML API) to detect elements and automatically generate descriptive tags.

🔹 Personalized Recommendations

User interactions (likes, views, follows) are analyzed to recommend similar artworks, ensuring a tailored discovery experience.
